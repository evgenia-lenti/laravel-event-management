    Welcome to the Event Management API documentation. This API allows you to manage events, registrations, and users.

    ## Authentication

    The API uses Laravel Sanctum for authentication. You can obtain a token by making a POST request to the `/api/v1/login` endpoint with your email and password.

    ## API Endpoints

    The API is organized around the following resources:

    - **Authentication**: Login and obtain an API token
    - **Events**: View published events and event details
    - **Event Registrations**: Register for events, unregister from events, and view your registrations

    <aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
    You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
